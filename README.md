***
*This is a plugin for Macro Deck 2, it does NOT function as a standalone app*
***
## Create your own soundboard
Create a button and configure your audio file.

You may choose either a local file or one from the web (please check you have permission, first!)

***
## Features

Currently the plugin supports only the following file types: 
```aif, aiff, mid, midi, m4a, mp3, ogg, oga, aac, flac, wma, wav``` <br/>
*Please open a request for any other file types you require.*

If you get an error, please make sure the path is correct or your connection hasn't dropped and that the file is the correct type. <br/>
*The plugin checks file signatures, not the file extension because the web is a scary place.*

| Action | Description | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
