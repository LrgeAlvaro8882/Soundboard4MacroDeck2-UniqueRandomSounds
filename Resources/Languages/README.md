# Contributing Languages 

This plugin has its own localization files, independent of Macro Deck.
These are in a json format and are parsed at application load.

If your language is not available, the plugin will default to English.

***

## If your language is missing or incomplete, please consider helping me out!

To contribute your language, join the project on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/soundboard4macrodeck2/invite?h=e5ad788cc5280bebf974497ff551d7901946848) and contribute your translation.

> ***REMEMBER to provide your username in the "\_attribution_" translation so that I may credit you.***

It's as simple as that! I will do the merging from there!

**You should be notified via email if I add new phrases, but be sure to check back in case!**
